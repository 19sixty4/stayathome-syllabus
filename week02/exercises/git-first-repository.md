Publish this repository to GitHub, untick 'Keep this code in private'!

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/)

  - Check your fresh and new repository
  - It should have 1 commit, and just an `.gitattributes` file

Now go back to the Github Desktop app, and open the repository's folder with Visual Studio Code

- Create a new file
  - Name it as `text.txt`
  - Type in your favourite movie's title and save it

In the Github Desktop app you can see the changes

![commit](../assets/my-first-repository/git-desktop-changes.png) 

Commit the changes to the master 

Push that commit to the origin

![push](../assets/my-first-repository/git-desktop-push.png) 

Check your origin repository again, and make sure your text file is there
