## Step by step

- Create a new repository with the name convention like: ***your-github-name.github.io***
- Publish your repository and make sure to untick *Keep this code private*
- Copy the content of the website what you made at `My first website` workshop day
- Commit your changes and push origin
- Now you can check ***your-github-name.github.io*** in your browser, and send everyone what you made before :)
- Make some change, push again, and check the differences
  - It usually takes a while for GitHub to update the content, so don't be afraid if it doesn't appear immediately
