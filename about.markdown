## How will you learn

You're going to cover 4 topics on the first 2 weeks. For each topic first you can get the overall picture by participating in a **Material Review**. This is going to happen on YouTube Stream and a mentor is going to go through the necessary parts. After that on the next day you'll join your study group to solve the **Workshop** exercises. Every study group has 8 members and you can help each other during the workshop. Discuss questions and give feedback to each other.

After the first 2 Material Review and Workshop there's a bigger exercise with what you will summarize and revisit the smaller chunks of knowledge from the week.

The third week is going to be a similar bigger exercise to complete your first web application where you can combine all the knowledge you learned so far.
